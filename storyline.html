        <div class="story-container p-4">
            <p>
                Long ago, Mirage was one. A world of starlit cities, crystal forests, and harmony between beings of magic and light. 
                But the harmony was fragile — and when the Great Event struck, reality shattered.
            </p>

            <p>
                Fragments of existence split apart. Entire lands became floating shards of space, drifting in the void.
                Truth and illusion blurred. Rivers flowed backwards in some realms, time froze in others. 
            </p>

            <h3>Sylwen’s Exile</h3>
            <p>
                Sylwen — a young elven mage — was exiled from her homeland, accused of unleashing the catastrophe. 
                They claimed that in her reckless attempts to help her people, she tampered with ancient forces she couldn’t control.
            </p>

            <p>
                But Sylwen remembers little. Her memories are fractured — flashes of magic, a blinding light, then silence.
                The Council insists she caused the calamity. But whispers in the Realms say otherwise.
            </p>

            <h3>The Heart of Mirage</h3>
            <p>
                Legends tell of an ancient crystal — the Heart of Mirage — holding the power to restore balance. 
                Sylwen sets out to find it, hoping to reclaim her honor and return home.
            </p>

            <p>
                Yet as she travels through the fragmented worlds, encountering cultures, creatures, and truths that don’t align...
                she begins to wonder:
            </p>

            <blockquote class="lead text-center my-4">
                <em>What if Mirage was never meant to be whole?</em>
            </blockquote>

            <p>
                Perhaps each shard is a world of its own — complete, alive, and real. 
                Perhaps truth is not singular. Perhaps balance is not what she was told.
            </p>

            <p class="ending">
                And somewhere deep within the shards, the Heart waits — not to restore what once was, 
                but to reveal what Mirage was always meant to be…
            </p>
