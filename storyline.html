            <p>
            Long ago, Aetherstone was whole, a world full of magic. The Crysalis kept the world balanced, and everyone shared one reality.
            Until the Veilburst happened. Shattering the known Crysalis into bits. The world was never the same again. The reality was split into fragments, drifting like islands in an endless void.
            Each fragment became its own reality, its own truth. Magic, time, and even physics could bend differently from one shard to another.
            The Veilburst’s nature is still unknown, since it was nothing like a spell, and definitely not an accident. Something far more powerful than the world could comprehend. 
            Sylwen was one of Veilburst’s victims, since as a young elf, she happened to be near the burst, causing her to have memory loss. And of course, causing her to be exiled, and blamed, for the destruction of the world.
            To prevent total collapse, an ancient crystal formed at an unknown location. 
            The Shard of Nymera.
            A relic capable of holding realities together
            or even erasing them forever.
            Some may call it salvation.
            Others may call it a weapon.

            Sylwen’s goal is to find the relic to restore balance, to hopefully find her way back home.

            But is everything Sylwen was taught true?
